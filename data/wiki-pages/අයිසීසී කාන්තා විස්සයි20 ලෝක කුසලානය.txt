The ICC Women's World Twenty20 is the biannual international championship for women's Twenty20 International cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), with the first edition being held in England in 2009. For the first three tournaments, there were eight participants, but this number has been raised to ten from the 2014 edition onwards. At each tournament, a set number of teams qualify automatically, with the remaining teams determined by the World Twenty20 Qualifier. Australia are the most successful team at the World Twenty20, having won three tournaments, while the most recent tournament in 2016 was won by the West Indies.

Qualification is determined by the ICC Women's Twenty20 international rankings and a qualification event, the Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier. Until 2014, six teams were determined by the top six teams of the ICC Women's Twenty20 International rankings at the time of the draw and the remaining two places determined by a qualification process.  For the 2014 tournament, six places are determined by the top eight teams of the ICC Women's T20I rankings, with the host country and three qualifiers joining them in the finals.
